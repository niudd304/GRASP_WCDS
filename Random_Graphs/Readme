These are 24 random graphs, which are randomly generated in the following way. 
In some fixed area N âˆ— N, a given number of points are randomly selected with a uniform distribution, which represent the nodes of the output graph. 
If the distance between two nodes i and j is smaller that some value R, edge (i, j) is a part of the output graph.
